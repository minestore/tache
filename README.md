# Tache
## Just enough Mustache for end users

Tache is a **full [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) implementation** with the *addition* of 'safe views'.

Safe views allow Tache templates to be edited by end users, without the risk jeopardising your application's security. When using safe views, only explicitly allowed methods are ever invoked and therefore calls to potentially destructive methods such as 'eval' or 'destroy' are ignored.

## Usage

Tache's safe views are an opt-in feature, so Tache will behave just as you'd expect a standard Mustache implementation to behave, unless *you* say otherwise.

### Standard Views

Quick example:

    require 'tache'
    
    Tache.render('Hello {{planet}}', 'planet' => 'World')
    => "Hello World"

Please note that all hash keys must be defined as strings when working with any Tache view. This minimises the risk of memory leaks caused by symbols when used in an end-user environment and is therefore a general requirement of Tache, regardless of whether or not you are using safe views.

Here's another way of doing things (no real departure from standard Mustache):

    class MyView < Tache
      def planet
        'World'
      end
      
      def star
        '*'
      end
      
      def stars
        star * 5
      end
    end
    
    view = MyView.compile("{{planet}} (rating: {{stars}})")
    view.render
    
Result:

    World (rating: *****)

### Safe Views

In order make use of Tache's safe views, you simply use `Tache::Safe` instead:

    require 'tache/safe'
    
    Tache::Safe.render('Hello {{planet}}', 'planet' => 'World')
    => "Hello World"
    
The first thing you will notice about safe views (other than them looking a lot like unsafe views), is that only values that have been explicitly exposed via safe view methods will be invoked. Therefore anything that has not been explicitly exposed will not be invoked or output to the rendered template:

    Tache::Safe.render('Hello {{planet.inspect}}', 'planet' => 'World')
    => "Hello "

Another example, this time subclassing `Tache::Safe`:

    class MySafeView < Tache::Safe
      def thing
        'World'
      end
  
      def present
        "I'm here!"
      end
  
      def bold
        lambda do |text|
          '<b>' + render(text) + '</b>'
        end
      end
    end

Template:

    Hello {{thing}}, here's safe view in action:

    self            -> {{.}}
    inspect         -> {{inspect}}
    to_sym          -> {{to_sym}}
    thing           -> {{thing}}
    present         -> {{present}}
    present.upcase  -> {{present.upcase}}

    Bold: {{#bold}}{{thing}}{{/bold}}

Render:

    view = MySafeView.compile(template)
    view.render
   
Result:

    Hello World, here's safe view in action:

    self            -> 
    inspect         -> 
    to_sym          -> 
    thing           -> World
    present         -> I'm here!
    present.upcase  -> 

    Bold: <b>World</b>
  
Notice how lambda's still work just as you'd expect but only explicitly exposed values are in the rendered output.

So, what if we want to expose something other than hash values or view object methods to our templates? Just subclass `Tache::Safe` and you're good to go, it's turtles all the way down:

Example:

    class Product
      def title
        'iPhone'
      end
  
      def price
        399
      end
  
      def destroy
        'Deleted product from database!'
      end
  
      # Returns product from database
      def self.first
        Product.new
      end
    end

    class ProductView < Tache::Safe
      def initialize(product)
        @product = product
      end
  
      def title
        @product.title
      end
  
      def price
        "$#{@product.price}"
      end
    end

    class CartView < Tache::Safe
      def product
        ProductView.new(Product.first)
      end
    end

Template:

    Product price: {{product.price}}
    Trying to destroy: {{product.destroy}}

    {{^destroy}}Bad luck hacker!{{/destroy}}

Render:

    view = CartView.compile(template)
    view.render

Result:

    Product price: $399
    Trying to destroy: 

    Bad luck hacker!

###Safe view shortcut

It can become monotonous having to create a drop class for any object you would like to expose to a template, therefore Tache also provides a shortcut for creating drops from existing objects.

Simply call the `tache` class method, supplying it with a list of methods you would like to be available in your templates and Tache will dynamically create a safd view for you behind the scenes:

    class Person
      include Tache::Safe::Auto
    
      tache :name, :occupation
      
      def name
        'Jamie'
      end
      
      def occupation
        'Developer'
      end
      
      def age
        "Don't ask"
      end
    end
    
Template

    {{#person}}
    Name: {{name}}
    Occupation: {{occupation}}
    Age: {{age}}
    {{/person}}
    
Render
    
    Tache::Safe.render(template, { 'person' => Person.new })
    
Result
    
    Name: Jamie
    Occupation: Developer
    Age: 

### Compiled templates and partials

Proper documentation on compiled templates and partials coming soon! For now, just see the code (it's pretty straight forward):

    # Compiled
    compiled = MyView.compile('Hello {{thing}}')
    compiled.render
    
    # Partials
    Tache::Safe.render('Hello {{>partial}}', { 'a' => 'b' }, { 'partial' => 'World' })
    
    # Both
    compiled = MyView.compile('Hello {{>partial}}')
    compiled.partials['partial'] = 'World
    compiled.render
    
You can even precompile a punch of partials (they'll get compiled for you automatically anyway but handy to know):

    compiled = MyView.compile('Hello {{>partial1}}, {{>partial2}}')
    compiled.partials = { 
      'partial1' => Tache::Template.compile('{{a.b.c}}'),
      'partial2' => Tache::Template.compile('{{a.b.c.d}}')
    }
    compiled.render

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'tache'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tache

Note: Tache requires at least Ruby 1.9.

## Testing

Tests are written with Test::Unit and can be run with Guard:

    bundle
    bundle exec guard
